# SIT323
Repository for SIT323 Cloud based application development for Neym Rizvi

All ontrack tasks will be uploaded here in their own folders with the Js file and the package.json file 

To initialise the program: 
download the .js file and **package.json** file NOT the package-lock file

run npm install or npm init in your terminal 

when node modules folder is created and all files are installed, 
run using node .\"name of file".js

or nodemon .\"name of file".js



This is not only for others to see but also for me to remember lol
